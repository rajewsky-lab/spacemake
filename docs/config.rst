Configuration
=============

Once installed, spacemake needs to be configured.

.. include:: shared/spacemake_init.rst

Optionally, you can also provide the ``--download_species`` flag, which will download Gencode genomes and
annotations for ``mouse`` and ``human``, and place them under ``project\_root/species\_data/<species>``,
where <species> is either mouse or human.

.. include:: shared/shared_sample_variables.rst

Configure species
-----------------

.. _configure-species:

To add species, the following command can be used::

   spacemake config add_species \
       --name NAME \         # name of the species to be added
       --reference REF \     # name of the reference sequence 
                             # ('genome', 'rRNA', 'spike_in', ...)
                             # if omitted defaults to 'genome'
       --sequence SEQUENCE \ # path to the reference sequence file 
                             # (.fa) to be added
       --genome SEQUENCE \   # DEPRECATED! Please use --sequence instead.
       --annotation ANNOTATION \
                             # path to the annotation (.gtf) file for the species
                             # to be added

The ``spacemake config update_species`` takes the same arguments as above, while ``spacemake config delete_species`` takes only ``--name``.

As of version ``0.7`` you can add multiple reference sequences per species. For that, 
simply execute ``add_species`` multiple times, varying ``--reference ...`` but keeping ``--name`` constant.


To list the currently available ``species``, type::
   
   spacemake config list_species

Configure barcode\_flavors
--------------------------

.. _configure-barcode_flavor:

This sample-variable describes how the cell-barcode and the UMI should be extracted from Read1 and Read2.
The ``default`` value for barcode\_flavor will be dropseq: ``cell = r1[0:12]`` (cell-barcode comes from first 12nt of Read1) and
``UMI = r1[12:20]`` (UMI comes from the 13-20 nt of Read1). 

**If a sample has no barcode\_flavor provided, the default run\_mode will be used**

Provided barcode\_flavors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spacemake provides the following barcode\_flavors out of the box:

.. code-block:: yaml

    default:
        cell: "r1[0:12]"
        UMI: "r1[12:20]"
    openst:
        cell: "r1[2:27]"
        UMI: "r2[0:9]"
    sc_10x_v2:
        cell: "r1[0:16]"
        UMI: "r1[16:26]"
    seq_scope:
        UMI: "r2[0:9]"
        cell: "r1[0:20]"
    slide_seq_14bc:
        cell: "r1[0:14]"
        UMI: "r1[14:23]"
    slide_seq_15bc:
        cell: "r1[0:14]"
        UMI: "r1[15:23]"
    visium:
        cell: "r1[0:16]"
        UMI: "r1[16:28]"

To list the currently available ``barcode_flavor``-s, type::
   
   spacemake config list_barcode_flavors

Add a new barcode\_flavor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   spacemake config add_barcode_flavor \
      --name NAME \
         # name of the barcode flavor

      --umi UMI \
         # structure of UMI, using python's list syntax.
         # Example: to set UMI to 13-20 NT of Read1, use --umi r1[12:20].
         # It is also possible to use the first 8nt of Read2 as UMI: --umi r2[0:8].

      --cell_barcode CELL_BARCODE
         # structure of CELL BARCODE, using python's list syntax.
         # Example: to set the cell_barcode to 1-12 nt of Read1, use --cell_barcode r1[0:12].
         # It is also possible to reverse the CELL BARCODE, for instance with r1[0:12][::-1]. 


Update/delete a barcode\_flavor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``spacemake config update_barcode_flavor`` takes the same arguments as above, while ``spacemake config delete_barcode_flavor`` takes only ``--name``.

Configure run\_modes
--------------------

.. _configure-run_mode:

Specifying a "run mode" is an essential flexibity that spacemake offers.
Through setting a ``run_mode``, a sample can be processed and analysed downstream in various fashions.

Each ``run_mode`` can have the following variables:

``n_beads``
   number of cell-barcode expected

``umi_cutoff``
   a list of integers. downstream the analysis will be run using these UMI cutoffs,
   that is cell-barcodes with less UMIs will be discarded

``clean_dge``
   whether to clean cell-barcodes from overhang primers, before creating the DGE.

``detect_tissue`` (spatial only)
   if ``True``, apart from UMI cutoff spacemake will try to detect the tissue *in-silico*.

``polyA_adapter_trimming``
   if ``True`` 3' polyA stretches and apaters will be trimmed from Read2.

``count_intronic_reads``
   if ``True`` intronic reads will be counted when creating the DGE.

``count_mm_reads``
   if ``True`` multi-mappers will be counted. Only those multi-mapping reads will be
   counted this way, which map to exactly one CDS or UTR segment of a gene.

``mesh_data`` (spatial only)
   if ``True`` a mesh will be created when running this ``run_mode``.

``mesh_type`` (spatial only)
   spacemake currently offers two types of meshes: (1) ``circle``, where circles with a given
   ``mesh_spot_diameter_um`` will be placed in a hexagonal grid, ``mesh_spot_distance_um``
   distance apart; (2) a hexagonal grid, where equal hexagons with ``mesh_spot_diameter_um``
   sides will be placed in a full mesh grid, such that the whole area is covered.

``mesh_spot_diameter_um`` (spatial only)
   the diameter of the mesh spatial-unit, in microns.

``mesh_spot_distance_um`` (spatial only, only for circle mesh)
   distance between the meshed circles, in microns.

``spatial_barcode_min_matches`` (spatial only)
   ratio spatial barcode matches, expressed as 0-1 interval, used as a minimum threshold to
   filter out pucks from DGE creation and subsequent steps of the pipeline. If set to 0, 
   no pucks are excluded.

``parent_run_mode``
   Each ``run_mode`` can have a parent, to which it will fall back.
   If a one of the ``run_mode`` variables is missing, the variable of the parent will be used.
   If parent is not provided, the ``default`` ``run_mode`` will be the parent.

.. note:: 
   If a ``run_mode`` variable is not provided, the variable of the default ``run_mode`` will be used

To list the currently available ``run_mode``-s, type::
   
   spacemake config list_run_modes

Add a new run\_mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See the :ref:`variable descriptions <configure-run_mode>` above.

.. code-block::

   spacemake config add_run_mode \
      --name NAME \ 
      --parent_run_mode PARENT_RUN_MODE \

      --mesh_spot_diameter_um MESH_SPOT_DIAMETER_UM \
      --mesh_spot_distance_um MESH_SPOT_DISTANCE_UM

Update/delete a run\_mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``spacemake config update_run_mode`` takes the same arguments as above, while ``spacemake config delete_run_mode`` takes only ``--name``.


Configure pucks
---------------

.. _configure-puck:

Each spatial sample is associated with a ``puck``. The ``puck`` variable defines the 
dimensionality of the underlying spatial structure, which spacemake uses
during the automated analysis and plotting, as well as the binning (meshing) of
the data when selected in the ``run_mode``.

Each puck has the following variables:

- ``width_um``: the width of the puck, in microns
- ``spot_diameter_um``: the diameter of bead on this puck, in microns.
- ``barcodes`` (optional): the path to the barcode file, containing the cell\_barcode
  and (x,y) position for each. This is handy when several pucks have the same barcodes,
  such as for 10x Visium.
- ``coordinate_system`` (optional): the path to the coordinate system file, containing puck
  IDs and the (x,y,z) position for each, in global coordinates. This coordinate system is analogous
  to the global coordinate system for image stitching. When specified, this 'stitching' is
  automatically performed on ``puck``-s with spatial information.


Provided pucks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

  default:
    coordinate_system: ''
    spot_diameter_um: 10
    width_um: 3000
  openst:
    coordinate_system: puck_data/openst_coordinate_system.csv
    spot_diameter_um: 0.6
    width_um: 1200
  seq_scope:
    spot_diameter_um: 1
    width_um: 1000
  slide_seq:
    spot_diameter_um: 10
    width_um: 3000
  visium:
    barcodes: puck_data/visium_barcode_positions.csv
    spot_diameter_um: 55
    width_um: 6500

The ``visium`` puck comes with a ``barcodes`` variable, which points to
``puck_data/visium_barcode_positions.csv``. Similarly, the ``openst`` puck comes with
a ``coordinate_system`` variable, pointing to ``puck_data/openst_coordinate_system.csv``.

Upon initiation, these files will automatically placed there by spacemake

To list the currently available ``puck``-s, type::
   
   spacemake config list_pucks


Add a new puck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   spacemake config add_puck \
      --name NAME \        # name of the puck
      --width_um WIDTH_UM \
      --spot_diameter_um SPOT_DIAMETER_UM \
      --barcodes BARCODES \ # path to the barcode file, optional 
      --coordinate_system COORDINATE_SYSTEM # path to the coordinate system file, optional 


Custom snakemake rules
----------------------

As of version ``0.7`` it is now possible to add custom snakemake rules to your spacemake workflow.
Simply add the following line to the ``config.yaml`` in your spacemake root folder:

.. code-block:: yaml

   custom_rules: /path/to/my_own_custom_snakefile.smk

Within your custom code, you can import spacemake modules and have access to internal variables.
If you need to make spacemake aware of new top-level targets that have to be made, 
you can register a callback

.. code-block:: python

   register_module_output_hook(get_my_custom_targets, "my_own_custom_snakefile.smk")

The function `get_my_custom_targets()` will be called once all other, internal spacemake code has been executed
and is expected to return a list of files that will be appended to the ``input:`` dependencies of the top-level 
rule. Providing rules to make these files is up to your custom rules.

The second parameter is more for logging purposes and allows to track which module or part of the 
code injected which dependencies. By default, it is good practive to use the filename.
