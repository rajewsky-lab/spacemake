After you have installed spacemake as specified :ref:`here <installation>`, you are ready to process and analyze spatial samples.

To initialize spacemake ``cd`` into the directory in which you want to start spacemake. This directory will be your ``project_root``.
Then simply type::
   
   spacemake init \
      --dropseq_tools <path_to_dropseq_tools_dir>

Here the `path_to_dropseq_tools_dir` should point to the directory of the downloaded Dropseq-tools package, downloaded :ref:`in Step 2 of the installation <step 2: download dropseq-tools>`.
