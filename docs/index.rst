Spacemake: processing and analyzing sequenced-based spatial transcriptomics data
================================================================================

Spacemake is a modular, robust, and scalable spatial transcriptomics pipeline built 
in Snakemake and Python. Spacemake is designed to handle all major spatial transcriptomics 
datasets and can be readily configured for other technologies. It can process and analyze 
several samples in parallel, even if they stem from different experimental methods. 
Spacemake's unified framework enables reproducible data processing from raw sequencing 
data to automatically generated downstream analysis reports. Spacemake is built with 
a modular design and offers additional functionality such as sample merging, saturation 
analysis, and analysis of long reads as separate modules.
