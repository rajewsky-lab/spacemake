# SPACEMAKE test data 

There is a mix of old and new stuff in here that needs to be cleaned up. In general, I think file size should not exceed 1 MB. If you need a larger file, let's place it on bimsbstatic and download it from there like so:

`wget https://bimsbstatic.mdc-berlin.de/rajewsky/spacemake-test-data/spacemake_tile_test_data.tar.gz`


Thanks!
